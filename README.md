## Structure of this repository 
The most important folders in this repository are the server and client folders,
First, the server folder contains the server.js file that is responsible for running the server side of the code. In addition to the server.js it contains the '.env' file, these two files are the most crucial part of it.
Second, the client folder, which itself has multiple parts,
first is the src folder, this folder consists of several codes regarding the overall structure of the website such as App.js, App.css, and index files, it also consists of two folders: services folder which contains js code files regarding certain services used, and the other folder is the components folder, this folder contains most of the components I used to build my frontend and its style. 
In addition to the src folder the client folder contains the public folder which mainly consists of some images used in the website or some images to get fetched in case there is no playlist image "Null value " along with the index.html file and more. 

The docs_phase3 directory have two files , one which is the video of the website in work , and the other one is a .txt file that contains a google drive link in case the you were unable to download/play the video  

## .env file 
The '.env' file is essential for running the server side of the code. To assist you, I have created a '.env.example' file in the server folder that contains the necessary variables. Please note that I have provided the values for these variables, such as API keys and client secrets, in the first slide of the Phase 2 submission. Therefore, you should create a '.env' file in the server directory and copy these values into it.

- npm install react-router-dom


## Starting the application 
**You need to go to the directories where the server.js is located, then enter this command to make the server side work:** 

node server.js 

if you download the code as a zip file, extract the files and 
ideally, the commands will be like: 
1-cd desktop 
2-cd ProjectJavaAndWebDevelopmentRamaObaid
3-cd server
--create the .env file here 
4-node server.js


**For the UI frontend part, you need to go to the directories where the codes exist and then start it by writing :**

npm start 
ideally the command will be like(if the files are downloaded into your local machine) : 
1-cd desktop 
2-cd ProjectJavaAndWebDevelopmentRamaObaid
3-cd client 
4-npm start 

**In case you want to clone it from git follow this:**

Steps to clone the repository directly from Git, please note that these steps assume that you have already installed Git into your system : 

First, clone the repository, as an example :
git clone https://github.com/rama26012004/ProjectJavaAndWebDevelopmentRamaObaid.git

Second, navigate to the cloned repository, as an example : 

cd ProjectJavaAndWebDevelopmentRamaObaid

Third, create the .env file in the server folder, and copy the values I have in the title slide, it's ideal to create a text file and then convert it to a .env file 

Fourth, you need to install the dependencies, as mentioned above, if you haven't yet 

Fifth, navigate to the server folder and start the node server.js,  as an example: cd ProjectJavaAndWebDevelopmentRamaObaid

cd server 

node server.js

Sixth, navigate to the client folder and start the frontend:
npm start 


## Limitations : 
Please note that if you need to log in to Spotify, I need to add your username and email as a tester in my developer dashboard; otherwise, authorization is not possible.
To make Spotify playlists and tracks work on my website directly the user using my website needs to have a premium account, therefore I eliminated this feature and only allowed users to redirect to the Spotify platform
